# what I was trying to do
I tried to read and understand the readings, listen to the podcast and made an attempt at the Transcribing task.

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing
While it isn't exactly research I have a friend whose wife actively works within Second Life making people homes and the like. So hearing you discuss Second Life was kind of fun since I knew what you were talking about.

## what I did

+ Listened to podcast
	+ gained knowledge of what to do for the week and general knowledge about digital archaeology
+ read the readings
	+ basic understanding of reading topics gained
+ Approached the trancsribing task
	+ Attempted to translate a phrase and I am unsure whether or not I was successful.

## challenges 
A major challenge is with trying to determine where to start your sentence for the transcribing task. Not knowing where to start your sentence I feel can have drastic effects on your ability to accurately translate.
## thoughts on where to go next
I am really looking forward to next weeks Archeogaming task.
